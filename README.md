# üçª PINGAHOLIC üçª

*Because your network needs a drinking buddy*

## What is Pingaholic?

Pingaholic is an ICMP-addicted network monitoring tool that stumbles around your local network, occasionally remembering to check if your devices are still alive. It's like that friend who promises to text you every hour during their night out, but the intervals between messages get increasingly random as the night progresses.

## Features

- **Turbo Mode**: When regular pinging just isn't irresponsible enough! Watch as Pingaholic downs a virtual energy drink and frantically pings everything at 5-second intervals until it inevitably crashes.

- **Unreliable Timing**: Is it going to ping in 60 seconds? 65? 70? Who knows! Pingaholic operates on its own schedule, much like your coworker who says they'll be "there in 5 minutes" but shows up half an hour later.

- **Network Discovery**: Like a drunk person wandering into random rooms at a house party, Pingaholic will scan your entire network and attempt to befriend any device that responds.

- **Beautiful Graphs**: Data visualization that gives you a false sense of professionalism while using what is essentially the digital equivalent of a college student with a ping fetish.

## ICMP: I Can't Maintain Consciousness Properly

Pingaholic sends ICMP Echo Request packets across your network with all the precision of a toddler throwing spaghetti. When it receives an Echo Reply, it celebrates like it just solved quantum physics, completely unaware that it's performing the most basic networking operation possible.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pingaholic.git
cd pingaholic
npm install
npm start
```

Then open your browser to http://localhost:8000 and watch the madness unfold.

## Developer Notes

This project was created by someone who once heard the word "ping" at a networking conference and thought, "Yeah, I could build an entire application around that." The author's knowledge of networking protocols extends about as far as "the internet is a series of tubes," and they're pretty sure ICMP stands for "I Created My Project" or possibly "Incredibly Cool Monitoring Program."

## Disclaimer

No packets were harmed in the making of this software, though several were delayed, dropped, or returned with increasingly hostile TTL values. If your network devices start responding with passive-aggressive ICMP replies, we take no responsibility. They probably just need a break from Pingaholic's constant neediness.
